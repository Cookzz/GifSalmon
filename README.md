An updated version of [GifTuna](https://github.com/dudewheresmycode/GifTuna) for 2025.

## What has changed

* Updated to the latest electron version & packager
* Updated to the latest dependencies
* Fixed breaking changes from dependency upgrades
* Ensure it can run, compile and function, at least in Windows 11 environment

## What has not changed

* 99% of the codebase. I have only updated all of the core and necessary lines that will make this function the same as before
* AngularJS (have not upgraded to Angular.io yet)
* No bug fixes were done (yet)

## Plans

* Update to Angular.io and deprecate AngularJS
* Re-writing of the entire application but will keep the core functionality, appearance, etc. the same the best I can.
* Bug fixes
* Auto-download of ffmpeg instead of prompting user to do it instead

## What is in progress

* Slowly migrating AngularJS to Angular v19 on a separate folder for testing, may take up to a month for anything to be ready
* Maintaining and cleaning up current codebase but will not do any drastic changes in preparation for version 2.0.0
* Fix bugs if there is any found

## Why

Because I'm actively using it daily with a few friends and there are some issues that I am very annoyed by and want to fix it but the main repo is already 8 years old and doesn't work/compile with my current dev env & tools when trying to set it up.
